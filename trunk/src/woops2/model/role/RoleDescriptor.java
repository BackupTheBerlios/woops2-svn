 * A Role Descriptor represents a Role in the context of one specific Activity. Every breakdown
 * structure can define different relationships of Role Descriptors to Task Descriptors and Work
 * Product Descriptors. Therefore one Role can be represented by many Role Descriptors each within
 * the context of an Activity with its own set of relationships.
